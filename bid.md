University:			University of Nebraska-Omaha

Project:			UNO Tech Lending Library

Project Agency (optional):	Dr. Hale

Technical Director / External Customer: 	Dr. Hale

Reason for wanting this project:

The University of Nebraska at Omaha has many resources for its community to use. For example, teachers can use these resources by requesting the item via the app. On the other hand, UNO faculty and staff will be able to monitor and track any item has been checked out by an individual. 

Project Scope:

The system will have two seperate interfaces, a client interface and and adminitrator interface.  The client interface will allow the user to request equipment or place a hold if all equipment is currenty unavailable. The adminitrator interface will allow the user to fulfill equipment requests, manage user, manage inventory, and check in returned equipment. This system will require a server-side database to track the users, equipment, and orders.

We are currently evaluating platforms for the system.  Our tentative plans are for a web-based system, where the system will be coded using a combination of CSS, javascript, a MySQL database, and a yet to be determinted server-side language.  Development work will be divided between the presentation layer (CSS and javascript) and server-side (logical code and database).
