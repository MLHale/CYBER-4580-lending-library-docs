There is a technology lending library that teachers/instructors in the local area have access to. This is a great asset for the instructors who use it but in its current form is very difficult for both the instructors borrowing and the instructors lending. On the lending side, all the products are manually tracked and requests from borrowers have to be manually responded to. On the borrowers side, a request for a product is sent blindly, with no knowledge of whether or not the requested product will be available in the near future if at all, or whether the request was received by the right individual. 

Our goals/objectives are as follows:

* To automate the request process.

* To create a web application that will allow instructors to see what products are currently available.

* To allow lenders to track inventory.

Our stretch goals/objectives are:

* To allow a new user to register via the web app.

* To allow borrowers to place all items needed for a module into their "cart" in one click.

Successful completion of this project will allow instructors to more easily lend out and borrow products. This will result in more use of the library by its intended users and thus more effective education practices for the instructors utilizing the system.
