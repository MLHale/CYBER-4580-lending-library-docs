General Notes:
* First, we are using Ember, Django, and PostgreSQL
* Linux box for hosting, other options should be looked at, we have options
* We NEED the Database schema for the project
* Potentially come up with users stories

Project proposal Notes:
* Executive summary - similar to the bid but needs to be expanded
   * Why problematic?
      * It is difficult to deal with requests from equipment, including tracking, and difficult for end users to know if everything is good on their end.
      * Descriptors and packages. (bonus)
   * Goals and objectives:
      * Implement an inventory tracking system (database)
      * Implement a user interface that is friendly to end-users
      * Implement an order tracking system
   * Merit? - (good place for stories)
      * Societal - more tech-savvy individuals
      * Otherwise answers the rest of the question
* Timeline - Gannt chart - tasks with expected time (after next week)
* Risk list 
   * People get sick
   * Lack of technical proficiency(in too deep)
   * Inadequate documentation for systems to be used
   * Hardware failures
   * Act of god (risks outside of our control)
   * Outside interference?
* Resources needed (ask for more info from Dr. Hale)
   * Server space
   * Barcode scanner?
   * Label Maker?
   * Web hosting?
   * Investigate the following
      * Ember.js
      * Django
      * postgreSQL
* Methodology
   * Literature review - research, keywords, what’s been done, etc.
   * Technical plan - what methods are we going to use, in-depth and specifics of the executive summary, scope
      * Best practices - SQL, HTML, javascript, python, etc
* Sprint plan (after next week)


Questions for Dr. Hale:
* Should we go for a domain or a server or no?
* Shipped or no?
* Do we need to worry about barcode scanners or anything?
   * If so, how far do you want it to go?
* How is this different from a regular library?
