UNO has a technology lending library that teachers/instructors in the local area have access to. This is a great asset for the instructors who use it but in its current form is very difficult for the lenders. Products and equipment being lent out are manually tracked, and requests for the products are handled manually via direct email to the facilitators. 
Our goals/objectives are as follows:
  *To automate the request process.
  *To create a web application that will allow instructors to see what products are currently available.
