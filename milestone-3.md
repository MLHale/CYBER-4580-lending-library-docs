# Progress Report 02MAY19
## Overview
  (brief overview)
  
Working towards completing our objectives has produced both successes and significant
challenges. After reviewing the feedback from our Milestone 2 results we decided to 
commit more of our teams resources to focused tasks and more effective dissemination 
of work. Specifically, we had been pausing our work on the frontend deliverables in 
order to focus more on just the backend and at the onset of Milestone 3 this changed. 
The team broke apart into individual and separate focus areas: finishing the backend, 
working on the frontend, further documentation, and security evaluation.

  (brief challenges)
  
Throughout this project we have been plagued with the inability to fully comprehend 
the interaction of the multiple systems involved in this product. While our ability 
to navigate around this challenge improved along the way, it never became a simple 
task.
