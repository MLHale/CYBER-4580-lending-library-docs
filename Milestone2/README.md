# Progress Report 3/28/2019
## Overview
We have created and are still implementing a database model that can be used for our Lending Library application. We are also working on frontend functionality including user authentication, displaying of inventory, and cart functionality.

## Outcomes
* Learned the basics of the Django and Ember.js frameworks
* Familiarized ourselves with the existing codebase provided by Dr. Hale
* Created our own development environments
* Implemented our database schema within models.py
* Started connecting Django models to usable views for the frontend
* Started modifying the frontend codebase for use in our application

## Hinderances
Our team lacks experience with the Ember.js and Django frameworks. Useful tutorials exist for each framework individually, however, we have not found much reference for combining these frameworks aside from their basic documentation. Successfully retrieving data from the backend would help us significantly in our frontend development efforts, yet implementing this capability is proving a challenge. Another issue is that we have not found a way to efficiently interact with the database when migrations cause an error that prevents Django from running. Futhermore, the existing codebase contains little documentation and includes a fair amount of imports and definitions that likely will not be used. It is mostly our lack of experience with the frameworks that is hindering our ability to implement parts of our project in a timely fashion.
